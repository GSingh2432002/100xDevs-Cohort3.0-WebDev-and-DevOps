What is Monorepos?
Monorepos (short for monolithic repositories) are a software development strategy where multiple projects or codebases are stored within a single version-controlled repository. Unlike multiple repositories where each project or microservice lives in its own repository, a monorepo centralizes all the code in one place. This approach is commonly used in large-scale development environments to promote better code sharing, consistency, and collaboration.

    Benefits of Monorepos:-
        Code Reuse and Collaboration: Developers can easily share and reuse code between different projects.
        Atomic Changes: One commit can update multiple projects or services simultaneously, ensuring compatibility.
        Unified CI/CD Pipelines: Build and deployment configurations can be centralized, making automation and integration simpler.
        Consistency: Easier to enforce coding standards and best practices across all projects.

            Popular Tools for Monorepos:- 
                Nx: A popular toolset for managing monorepos, particularly in TypeScript and JavaScript projects.
                Bazel: Originally developed by Google, itâ€™s a powerful build tool designed to handle large-scale monorepos.
                Lerna: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
                Turborepo: Designed for high-speed builds and managing multiple packages.
