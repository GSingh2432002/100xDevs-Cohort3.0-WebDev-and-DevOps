What is DOM?
The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
eg:-
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Simple app</title>
		<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage content for search engines and social media.">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>
			hi there
		</h1>
	</body>
</html>

Why DOM?
The DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects, allowing scripts to mainpulate the content and structure dynamically. This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML.

Static HTML:-
As the name suggests, static HTML represents HTML that does not change. In this given code if we click on the Add Todo button, nothing happens
eg:-
<html>
	<head>
	  <meta charset="utf-8">
	  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
	  <title>replit</title>
	  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
	</head>
	<body>
	  <h1>Todo list</h1>
	  <h4>1. Take class</h4>
	  <h4>2. Go out to eat</h4>
	  <div>
	    <input type="text"></input>
	    <button>Add Todo</button>
	  </div>
	  <script src="script.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>

Dynamic HTML:-
How can we update the elements of the page dynamically?

Assignment:-
When the user clicks on the Add todo button, a new TODO should be added.

Document object:-
In the browser, the document object is a fundamental part of the Document Object Model. It represents the web page currently loaded in the browser and provides a way to interact with and mainpulate its content.
